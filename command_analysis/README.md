# Command Analysis Toolkit

This directory contains tools and data for analyzing and verifying MUD commands.

## Files

- **`commands.json`**: The final verified command registry. Contains:
    - Basic metadata (name, category, file path).
    - Help text, Format, and Examples extracted from source.
    - **Interaction**: Real input/output logs captured from the MUD.
- **`scan_cmds.py`**: Static analysis script. Scans `../mudlib/cmds` to generate the initial JSON.
- **`verify_cmds.py`**: Verification script. Connects to local MUD (port 4000), logs in, and tests commands to capture real-time output.
- **`verification.log`**: Log file generated by `verify_cmds.py`.

## Usage

1.  **Scan Commands**:
    ```bash
    python3 scan_cmds.py
    ```
    Generates `commands_initial.json`.

2.  **Verify & Capture**:
    Ensure your MUD server is running on `127.0.0.1:4000`.
    ```bash
    python3 verify_cmds.py
    ```
    This will:
    - Log in automatically (creates user `测试员` if needed).
    - Test all `std` and `usr` commands.
    - Generate `commands_verified.json`.
